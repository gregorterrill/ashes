				<h1>About Ashes Online</h1>
				<p>Ashes Online is a fan project by <a href="https://twitter.com/GregorTerrill">@GregorTerrill</a>. I am a web developer and board/card game geek from Ottawa, Canada.</p>

				<p>Ashes: Rise of the Pheonixborn is a card game by <a href="http://www.plaidhatgames.com">Plaid Hat Games</a>. I am not associated with them in any way. If you like Ashes, please show them your support by <a href="http://www.plaidhatgames.com/store">purchasing their products</a> and spreading the word about their game in your local and online communities.</p>

				<p>This project was inspired by <a href="http://jinteki.net">Jinteki.net</a>, a fan-made online version of Android: Netrunner, which is another card game I've been playing for several years. That platform (and the OCTGN module by db0 that came before it) has been invaluable to the Android: Netrunner community, and allows players to squeeze in practice games when in-person games are too time-consuming, or opponents are difficult to find/organize. Without it, I don't think the competitive Netrunner scene would be what it is today.</p>

				<p>I decided to build Ashes Online just after I started playing Ashes, and was looking for a way to get more practice in. I was also looking for a web app project to build to learn Vue, which I was starting to use at my day job.</p>

					<h2>Decklist Formatting</h2>

					<p>Until a proper deckbuilder is added, decklists need to be formatted in a specific JSON structure. This is how Aradel's deck from the core set looks:</p>

					<pre style="tab-size: 2rem;">
{
	"name": "The Mist Guardian",
	"pheonixborn": "Aradel Summergaard",
	"deck": {
		"Shifting Mist": 3,
		"Summon Mist Spirit": 3,
		"Summon Blue Jaguar": 3,
		"Reflections in the Water": 3,
		"Mist Typhoon": 3,
		"Out of the Mist": 3,
		"Root Armor": 3,
		"Steady Gaze": 3,
		"Massive Growth": 3,
		"Summon Butterfly Monk": 3
	},
	"dice": {
		"nat": 5,
		"ill": 5,
		"cer": 0,
		"cha": 0
	}
}</pre>

					<p>Each decklist should contain a name, pheonixborn, deck (containing card names with values totalling 30), and dice (leave the three-letter keys as is, values must total 10). Careful with your spelling - cards are looked up based on title, so typos will cause errors.</p>
					<p>Your JSON must be valid to work - watch for trailing commas on the last item between each curly brace. You can also paste your list into <a href="http://jsonlint.com/">JSONLint</a> which will point out where any errors are occuring.</p>
					<p>Hopefully a deck builder will be added in the not-so-distant future to take care of this formatting for you!</p>
